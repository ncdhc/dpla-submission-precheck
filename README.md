DPLA Submission Pre-Check
=========================

These tools are intended for use by a Service Hub's partners as a means to preview their content after the Hub has normalized it for submission to the DPLA.

The preview mirrors, as closely as possible, the actual output of harvested content on the DPLA's website: <http://dp.la>

Included is an OAI proxy viewer. This is useful if the repository itself is closed to the public; as long as interactions from the server where this tool resides is allowed by the server hosting the repository, this will allow outside users to view single OAI records as a means of troubleshooting.


Version
-------

1.0

Technology
----------

The DPLA Submission Pre-Check tool requires the following to function properly:
  - PHP 5 or higher
  - libxml extension (enabled in PHP 5 by default)
  - php_curl extension
  - php_xsl extension

In addition, the following will need to be provided in the included config.php file:
  - provider name
  - provider OAI base URL
  - the metadata prefix of the records harvested by the DPLA
    -  if this is anything other than NCDHC-mapped MODS, new "analysis" and "samplerecord" XSL stylesheets will be required
  - a help contact name
  - a help contact email
  - a help contact phone number

This tool is built with Bootstrap 3.1.1 and Bootstrap Theme, included in this release.

Installation
------------

This tool assumes that the data set specifications in your repository follow a partner-specific naming convention:

```sh
somecode_setname
```

i.e.,

```sh
ncdhc_postcards
```

The partner-specific code in front of the set name (in the above examples, "somecode" or "ncdhc") is required to begin using this tool.

Unzip files into a web-accessible directory or local evironment. Visit:

```sh

```
